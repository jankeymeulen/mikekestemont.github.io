I’m very proud of the scientific documentary that we have recently released: *Hildegard of Bingen: Authorship and Stylometry*. Please check it out in High Definition on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/70881172) or in the embedded version below. This documentary will tell you a lot that you might want to know about my type computational research in the Digital Humanities and the field of medieval studies. The documentary has been shown for the first time on 18 July 2013 at the Digital Humanities 2013 conference in Lincoln, Nebraska (USA). The research reported on is based on the scientific article: Kestemont, M.; Moens, S. & Deploige, J., ‘Collaborative Authorship in the Twelfth Century. A Stylometric Study of Hildegard of Bingen and Guibert of Gembloux’, *LLC: The Journal of Digital Scholarship in the Humanities* (Oxford University Press) [[advance access]](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/10/26/llc.fqt063.abstract). We made this documentary with the wonderfully helpful and talented professionals: Jo Bruyninckx (Camera & Editing), Johan Limbourg (Sound), Sander van Dijck (Visual FX) and Bram Tack (Still Photography). Thanks for an amazing job, guys! We have all put a lot of work in this documentary so please feel free to share our work with your friends and colleagues. We value your feedback: please let us know what you thought of it!
